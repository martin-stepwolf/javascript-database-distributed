### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Project developed in a subject when I was student.
As better developer **I improved all the project** with my better skills.

As IT student, I knew already about JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Now I know better practices, I improved the project with:

- Do not add unnecessary files to the repository (libraries and images), and use external sources.
- Implement better functions and use let and const instead of var in JavaScript.
- Better practices in files and directories.
- Better HTML semantic.
